Implementation of a shallow Neural Network

# file descriptions
UAT_test.py is a visualization tool that shows the different lines created by an NN. You must initialize the weights and biases manually. 

shallowNN.py is an implementation of a shallow NN that allows you to mess with hyperparameters. It also plots the expected line and the predicted line with each iteration
